<h2>Scope Chains &amp; Closures</h2>

<p>Learn how to use Scopes and Closures with NodeJS with the <a href="https://github.com/jesstelford/scope-chains-closures">Scope Chain and Closures</a> workshop.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Be sure you've gone through the <a href="http://nodeschool.io/austin/#getting-started">initial setup found on the Austin NodeSchool website</a>, including installing Node, and making sure <code>npm</code> is available from the command line.</p>

<h3>Install the Workshop</h3>

<p>Use <code>npm</code> to install the workshop globally. This will place the workshop binary in your <code>PATH</code> so that you can access it from the command line.</p>

<p><code>
$ npm install -g scope-chains-closures
</code></p>

<h3>Setup your Workspace</h3>

<p>Create a new directory to do your workshop work in.  Let's call it "learning_closures".</p>

<p><code>
$ mkdir learning_closures &amp;&amp; cd !$
</code></p>

<h2>Workshoop Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Select a problem to work on</h3>

<p>With the workshop installed, run <code>scope-chains-closures</code> to print a menu where you can select a problem to work on.</p>

<p>You can also type <em>sccjs</em></p>

<p><code>
$ sccjs
</code></p>

<p>Problems are listed in rough order of difficulty. You are advised to complete them in order, as later problems will build on skills developed by solving previous problems.</p>

<h3>2. Write your solution</h3>

<p>Once you have selected a problem, the workshop will remember which problem you are working on. Using your preferred editor, simply create a file to write your solution in.</p>

<h3>3. Test your solution</h3>

<p>This workshop allows you to run your solution by using the command <code>scope-chains-closures run</code>. Use this command to test your solution. Your solution will be loaded and passed the problem input. This usually won't perform any validation, it will only show the program output.</p>

<p><code>
$ scope-chains-closures run &lt;your_file.js&gt;
</code></p>

<h3>4. Verify your solution</h3>

<p>This workshop requires that you run your solution through <code>scope-chains-closures</code>. Using the workshop's <code>verify</code> command, your solution will be verified against the output of the "official" solution. If all of the output matches, then you have successfully solved the problem!</p>

<p><code>
$ scope-chains-closures verify &lt;your_file.js&gt;
</code></p>

<h2>Code Away!</h2>

<p>Make you're way through the workshop an exercise at a time. Please ask someone if you get stuck, and/or <a href="http://nodeschool.io/austin/#contact">contact Austin NodeSchool</a> if you need help outside of an event. Good luck and have fun!</p>
