## Scope Chains & Closures ##
Learn how to use Scopes and Closures with NodeJS with the [Scope Chain and Closures](https://github.com/jesstelford/scope-chains-closures) workshop.

## Setup ##

Be sure you've gone through the [initial setup found on the Austin NodeSchool website](http://nodeschool.io/austin/#getting-started), including installing Node, and making sure `npm` is available from the command line.

### Install the Workshop

Use `npm` to install the workshop globally. This will place the workshop binary in your `PATH` so that you can access it from the command line.

```
$ npm install -g scope-chains-closures
```

### Setup your Workspace

Create a new directory to do your workshop work in.  Let's call it "learning_closures".

```
$ mkdir learning_closures && cd learning_closures
```

## Workshoop Instructions

### 1. Select a problem to work on

With the workshop installed, run `scope-chains-closures` to print a menu where you can select a problem to work on.

You can also type _sccjs_

```
$ sccjs
```

Problems are listed in rough order of difficulty. You are advised to complete them in order, as later problems will build on skills developed by solving previous problems.

### 2. Write your solution

Once you have selected a problem, the workshop will remember which problem you are working on. Using your preferred editor, simply create a file to write your solution in.

### 3. Verify your solution

This workshop requires that you run your solution through `scope-chains-closures`. Using the workshop's `verify` command, your solution will be verified against the output of the "official" solution. If all of the output matches, then you have successfully solved the problem!

```
$ scope-chains-closures verify <your_file.js>
```

## Code Away! ##

Make you're way through the workshop an exercise at a time. Please ask someone if you get stuck, and/or [contact Austin NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/austin/#contact) if you need help outside of an event. Good luck and have fun!
