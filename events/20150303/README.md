# COUNT TO 6 #

The _Count To 6_ Adventure NodeSchool workshop provides an overview of
[EMCAScript6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts).

## Setup ##

Be sure you've gone through the
[initial setup found on the Austin NodeSchool website](http://nodeschool.io/austin/#getting-started),
including installing Node, and making sure `npm` is available from the command line.

Install the `count-to-6` workshop:

`$ npm install -g count-to-6`

## Start the Workshop ##

To start up the workshop, issue the following command from the terminal:

`$ count-to-6`

Select the first exercise from the list, `HELLO ES6`, and hit enter to see the
instructions for this problem.

### Solve the Exercise ###

Once you've understood what needs to be accomplished, open a file with your
favorite editor, add the solution to it, and save it as `program.js`.

Now, from the command line you can `run` or `verify` your solution. To run
the program and see what the output looks like, issue the following command:

`$ count-to-6 run program.js`

Once you're satisfied with the output, `verify` the solution:

`$ count-to-6 verify program.js`

The workshop will pass or fail your solution based on if it performs the actions
correctly as explained in the exercise. If it passes, congratulations!! You can
now proceed on to the next problem.

## Code Away! ##
