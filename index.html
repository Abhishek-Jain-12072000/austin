                <p>Austin NodeSchool is part of the global <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> effort to voluntarily teach Node.js to anyone! The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven. And the best part is, it's all free!</p>

                <p>Austin NodeSchool meets on the <strong>first Tuesday of the month</strong>, and generally rotates locations every month between a North and South location to allow folks a better chance to attend an event. The meetings are working sessions, so <strong>please bring a laptop</strong>. Folks will be available to help if you're just getting started with Node, or even if you're a seasoned veteran and want to learn more.</p>

                <p>Please see our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atxnodejs/">Meetup page</a> for more information on the next meeting.</p>

                    <li>Node API documentation: <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">http://nodejs.org/api</a></li>
                    <li>npm (Node's package manager): <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">https://www.npmjs.org</a></li>
                    <li>Mozilla Developer Network (JavaScript documentation): <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Installing Node</h3>
                <p>When installing Node through the default install binaries, the install path (on a Mac or Unix machine) is within a directory that requires root permission. This can lead to having to run <code>sudo</code> when interacting with Node. Because of this, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> when installing Node, since it will install Node into your user's home directory (avoiding any permissions problems).</p>
